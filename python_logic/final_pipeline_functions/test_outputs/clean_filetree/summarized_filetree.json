It leverages the OpenAI API to analyze and return summaries of Python code functions. The main components of the script are as follows:\n\n1. **summarize_functions**: This function takes a string representation of Python code and uses the OpenAI API to summarize all functions within the provided code. It returns a JSON-encoded string containing the function names and their respective descriptions.\n\n2. **summarize_functions_in_directory**: This function navigates through a specified directory and identifies Python files. For each file, it reads the file content and uses the `summarize_functions` to generate function summaries. These summaries are then compiled into a dictionary with relative file paths as keys, and the result is saved as a JSON file at a specified output path.\n\n3. **main**: Demonstrates the usage of `summarize_functions_in_directory`. It specifies a directory path containing Python scripts and an output path for the JSON file where function summaries will be written.\n\nThe script relies on the OpenAI client, configured with an API key, to connect and retrieve function summaries. It interacts with the file system to read Python scripts, processes them, and writes summarized descriptions into a JSON file, serving as documentation or analysis tool for the codebase within the specified directory.",
