It includes a single function, `read_csv`, which opens a specified CSV file (e.g., `data/weather_2018.csv`, `data/weather_2019.csv`, `data/weather_2020.csv`) and returns its content as a list of rows. The function uses Python\u2019s built-in `csv` module to read each row and append it to a list. The script then reads weather data from CSV files for the years 2018, 2019, and 2020, storing the results in respective variables. The script lacks error handling for missing values in the CSV files and uses simple print statements to display the data, which are more suited for debugging rather than formal logging or output methods. The script doesn\u2019t reference or require functions from other files in the project, and its primary use is to load and inspect CSV data.",

The function contains limitations, such as misformatted data entries (missing temperature values in some rows) and direct printing of results rather than outputting to a file. It does not handle errors or None values effectively.\n\nThe script does not employ any error handling or data validation techniques and operates on a static dataset within the function itself rather than processing external data files or integrating with other code modules from the project.",
