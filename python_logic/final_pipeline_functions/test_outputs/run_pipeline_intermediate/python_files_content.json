After reading the files, it assigns the data to `data_2018`, `data_2019`, and `data_2020` variables respectively.\n\nWhile this script effectively reads data from files, it lacks error handling for issues such as missing or malformed data. Additionally, it prints the retrieved data directly to the console for debugging, but does not utilize logging or more sophisticated debugging techniques to track the data reading process or handle exceptions that may arise during file operations.
